# 🎯 Manual Game Selection Guide

## ✅ New Features Added!

You can now:
1. **See ALL games for today** (not just the first 2-3)
2. **Manually select which game goes to which channel**
3. **Set your own priorities** (so Indiana can be Priority 1 instead of New York!)

## 📺 How To Use The New Interface

### Step 1: Enter Your Channels

Your channels are already configured:
- **Channel 516** (saved as Priority 1)
- **Channel 28** (saved as Priority 2)

### Step 2: Load All Today's Games

1. In the web interface at http://localhost:8080
2. Scroll to **"Step 1: Configure Channels & Select Games"**
3. Click **"Load Today's Games"**

You'll see ALL games for today, including:
- **🔴 LIVE** games currently in progress
- Scheduled games
- Completed games

### Step 3: Map Games to Channels

For each game you want to monitor:

1. Find the game (e.g., "Indianapolis Colts @ Los Angeles Chargers")
2. Select which channel to use from the dropdown:
   - **Channel 516 (Priority 1)** ← Pick this for Indiana game!
   - **Channel 28 (Priority 2)** ← Pick this for another game
3. Click **"Map Game"**
4. The card will turn blue to show it's selected

### Example Setup

**For your preference (Indiana as highest priority):**

1. Find: **Indianapolis Colts @ Los Angeles Chargers**
   - Select: "Channel 516 (Priority 1)"
   - Click: "Map Game"

2. Find: **New York Giants @ Denver Broncos**
   - Select: "Channel 28 (Priority 2)"
   - Click: "Map Game"

Now when both teams are in the redzone, it will prioritize the Colts game!
